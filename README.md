## Overview

Our repo contains R code using Seurat package to analyze mouse brain transcriptome. We identified the 10 most highly variable genes and plotted as a figure.

## Data

Total of 56 mouse brains were used to produce single-cell transcriptomic profiling data(GSE222510) with 158,767 cells in total. You can access data through following link:
